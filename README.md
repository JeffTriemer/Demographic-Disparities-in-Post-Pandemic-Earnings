# Team-101 Repository

This repository is dedicated to Team 101's group project for the MGT 6203 course during the Fall semester of 2023 (Canvas).

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and derive insights from the "Ask a Manager Salary Survey 2021" dataset. Our analysis includes various stages, from data extraction and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and finally presenting our findings through visualizations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **Code**: Contains notebooks necessary to run the project's code.
- **Data**: Stores both raw and processed datasets. This folder will be created by you.
- **Final Report**: Holds the final outcome and conclusions of our project.
- **Progress Report**: Includes documentation of our progress in the project.
- **Project Proposal**: Contains our initial project proposal.
- **Visualizations**: Stores the visual outputs generated by our code.

## Running the Code

To replicate our analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoomaalghawas/ask-a-manager-salary-survey-2021/). 
3. Create a directory named `Data` in the root of the project (i.e. same level as `Code`).
4. Name the file `ask_a_manager_data.csv`, and save it into that `Data` folder.
5. Run the notebooks in the `Code` directory in the following order:
    - Data Extraction & Preprocessing
    - Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Feature Engineering & Modelling
